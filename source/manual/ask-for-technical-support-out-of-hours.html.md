We try to make the GOV.UK publishing platforms as self-service as possible, so
technical involvement in content changes should usually be unnecessary.

In some situations, such as site wide changes or urgent new features, we may
need engineers to help make changes outside working hours.

To reduce the stress around this process and the risk of things going wrong, we
have a standard process, as follows.

## Work out what needs to be done

First of all, make sure you understand the user need that's being addressed by the change.

Talk to [the team that owns the application](/apps/by-team.html) you need to
change to confirm that this is something that needs to be done by engineers in
overtime.

## Ask us for help on Slack

[#govuk-tech-overtime](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C0105S28F7A)

This slack channel is monitored by senior members of the technical team, who
can help triage your request and find the right people to help you.

You should be able to explain:

* what you need
* why it's important
* why it needs to happen out of hours
* why it needs an engineer to make the change

You should let us know who the main point of contact should be from a
non-technical point of view.

Let us know who you've worked with so far (for example if you've already spoken
to people for advice, or had people help prepare a change).

## What we'll do

If we agree that a change needs out of hours technical support, we will:

* find someone from the technical team to lead on the work, so you have a
single point of contact.
* help the lead person determine how many other people need to be involved (and who they should be)

## How to communicate during technical changes out of hours

Create a google doc as a playbook. Make sure that there's a detailed written
plan of what needs to be done to make the change. Consider if there are things
that may go wrong, and how you'll respond if they do.

Unless everyone will be in the office, you should set up a single-use Slack
channel for communications during the change.

## Time off in lieu and overtime payments

We will make sure that everyone who works overtime is compensated with time off
in lieu and overtime payments, in line with Cabinet Office and GDS policies.
